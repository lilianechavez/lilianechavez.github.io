          <h4>Brotherhood 2.0</h4>
          <p>When Hank and John first started making videos, they called it Brotherhood 2.0. They goal was to only contact each other through videos on YouTube, and to post videos everyday for a year. They came up with rules about the project, and if either broke one of these rules, then their auidence would get to decide their punishment. Hank and John would talk about their day, record themselves doing silly things, and explain any important, complicated topic about the world. Sometimes they would mix both silly activities and serious topics, such John's infamous video discussing the civil war in Sri Lanka while putting peanut butter on his face.</p>

          <h4>The Road to Fame</h4>
          <p>At first, the vlogbrtohers would only receive about a hundred views for each video. However, since the borthers proudly proclaim themselves as nerds, Hank green decided to write a song about Harry Potter and post it. The video was a success as it appeared on the trending list on YouTube's home page. Soon afterwards, they began receiving thousands of views for each video (which was a lot at the time).</p>

          <h4>After Brotherhood 2.0</h4>
          <p>Once the two brothers realized they had a large audience that enjoyed their videos, they decided to continue uploading content, only this time they decided to each post a video once a week. They slowly gained more subscribers and captivated their audience with their informative yet quirky videos. Many of their most popular videos deal with heavy, but important topics such as the chlorea outbreak in Yemen, the economic crisis in Greece, the refugee crisis in Syria, and many more.</p>

      <h2>The Project for Awesome</h2>
      <p>Hank and John Green decided to use their fame to their advantage to donate to charity. They ran a fundraiser through their videos in December. They were able to raise several thousand dollars; and as a result, they distributed the money among several charitable organizations. After several years, the Green brothers started The Foundation to Decrease World Suck as a registered charity. Every year since the first fundraiser, in December the brothers do a 48 hour livestream called the Project for Awesome asking the YouTube community to donate and to post videos explaining which charities should receive the smaller $5,000 grants. They also ask the public to vote which organizations should receive the largest grants.</p>
